# Team-Project

Hello Everyone!!

In our team project, we were able to show you a program that was able to give a list
of options that they can be able to choose from. You can be able to choose any number 
from the list and it would be able to print the statement. You can also change the statement 
to your own statemtent as well to be able to print that statement as well. This program is 
important since it can print any statment when you pick a number.
